# 🎓 University ERP System (Java + Swing)

A desktop-based **University ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)** system developed using **Java and Swing**, designed to manage courses, sections, enrollments, and grades with **role-based access control** and **secure authentication**.

The project follows a **layered architecture**, separates **authentication data from academic data**, and supports a global **Maintenance Mode** to ensure data safety during administrative operations.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The system follows a clean **layered architecture**:

UI Layer (Swing Frames)  
↓  
Access / Service Layer  
↓  
DAO Layer  
↓  
Databases (Auth DB + ERP DB)

## 📦 Package Structure

edu.univ.erp
├── ui // All Swing UI frames and dialogs
├── domain // Data models (Student, Course, Section, Grade, etc.)
├── data // DAO classes (StudentDAO, CourseDAO, EnrollmentDAO, etc.)
├── auth // Authentication & password hashing
├── access // Role checks & maintenance enforcement
├── util // Utilities (DB helpers, backup/restore)
└── Main.java // Application entry point

## 🔐 Authentication & Security Design

- The system uses **two separate databases**:
  - **Auth Database**
    - Stores username, role, password hash
    - No academic data
  - **ERP Database**
    - Stores students, instructors, courses, sections, enrollments, grades
    - Never stores passwords

- Password handling:
  - Passwords are never stored in plaintext
  - Only secure hashes are stored
  - Password verification uses one-way hashing
  - Follows a UNIX “shadow password” style design

- Authentication and authorization are fully decoupled

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 17 or later)
- Java Swing (Desktop UI)
- Maven (Build & dependency management)
- JDBC (Database connectivity)
- MySQL / MariaDB (or compatible RDBMS)

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

- Java JDK installed
- Maven installed (`mvn -v` should work)
- Database configured and running

---

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/UniversityERP.git
cd UniversityERP



### 🧪 Validation & Safety Checks

Duplicate enrollments are prevented

Section capacity is strictly enforced

Deadline-based drop restrictions are applied

Role-based access control is enforced at every write operation

Maintenance Mode blocks all student and instructor modifications

Clear and user-friendly error messages are shown

### 🔧 Maintenance Mode

Controlled by the Admin

When enabled:

Students and Instructors can only view data

All create / update / delete operations are blocked

A visible banner is shown across the UI

Ensures consistency during maintenance or backup operations

### 💾 Backup & Restore

ERP database can be backed up by the Admin

Restore functionality reverts the database to a previous state

Useful for demos, testing, and recovery

### 📄 Documentation Included

UML and architecture diagrams

Test plan and test summary

Seed scripts

Demo video

How-to-run guide

### 🎯 Learning Outcomes
